## New features

* Async commit
  - Fix regression due to high failure rate of get requests [tikv/8470](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/8470)
  - (wip) Update max ts when a region becomes leader [tikv/8468](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/8468)
  - Carry read ts and ranges in ReadIndex [kvproto/665](https://github.com/pingcap/kvproto/pull/665)

* Commit transactions with concurrent DDLs [18098](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/18098) @cfzjywxk
  - Add a session [variable](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/19321) to turn it on/off. 
  - Adding more test cases to cover more situations, the [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17HwhQBhg82z9FLF2on2rgp3fj3seYNduGtB3J_oy4XE/edit), adding utf [cases](https://github.com/pingcap/automated-tests/pull/455).

## Test & Bugfix

## Others

* Benchmark [avoid pipeline stall in pipelined pessimistic locking](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/8451) @youjiali1995
  - [Result](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14sQiQJjvJvf0s1gJr_FNTWAuDS-d8tvo3IBBZSSMuwI/edit#heading=h.6ykkcqi95956)
  - No improvement because when write pressure is low, pipeline stall is negligible; when pressure is high, performance is limited by raftstore.
  - Won't be merged until I can find a elegant implementation.
