## Test & Bugfix

* Pipelined pessimistic locking @youjiali1995
  - Write a [tipocket test](https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket/pull/301) to test the success rate of it under heavy contention and frequent scheduling workload. The failure rate is about 0.05% for now.
  - Notify clients after acquire lock requests are proposed to the raftstore successfully [8449](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/8499). The failure rate is 0 with this PR, so I enable it by default.
